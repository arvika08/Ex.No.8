## **Aim**

To demonstrate how text-to-image generation tools can reproduce an existing image using carefully crafted prompts. This experiment involves analyzing key elements in an image, designing prompts, refining them, and generating outputs that closely resemble the original.

---

## **Procedure**

1. **Analyze the Given Image**
   Identify:

   * Objects / subjects
   * Colors
   * Textures
   * Lighting
   * Style
   * Background
   * Composition

2. **Write the Basic Prompt**
   Start with a simple image description.

3. **Refine the Prompt**
   Add specific details: colors, textures, mood, time, style.

4. **Identify Style/Art Influences**
   Specify whether the image is realistic, anime-style, watercolor, etc.

5. **Fine-tune and Adjust**
   Add more precise details to match the original.

6. **Generate the Image**
   Use DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, or MidJourney.

7. **Compare and Improve**
   Check similarity with the original and refine prompts if required.

## **Tools Used**

* **DALL·E**
* **Stable Diffusion**
* **MidJourney**

# **IMAGE 1 — Dog Swimming in Pool**


## **Original Image**

<img width="1024" height="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e8a1cab-24b5-4b87-8f60-11f89ac91a78" />

## **Prompt 1 — Basic Prompt**

```
A golden retriever swimming in a pool holding a tennis ball.
```

## **Prompt 2 — Refined Prompt**

```
A golden retriever swimming happily in a clear blue pool, holding
a yellow tennis ball in its mouth. Sunlight shines on the water,
creating bright reflections and ripples. The background shows a garden with green plants,
flowers, and empty lounge chairs near the poolside.
```

## **Prompt 3 — Final Detailed Prompt**

```
A photorealistic image of a wet golden retriever swimming in a sparkling turquoise pool,
holding a bright yellow tennis ball in its mouth. Sunlight creates shimmering reflections on the
water surface and clear shadows beneath the dog. The background includes stone pool edges, lounge chairs,
potted plants, and a lush garden filled with colorful flowers and greenery under a bright sunny sky.
```

## **Generated Image**

<img width="1024" height="559" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eacc25b-a235-40f6-8b62-4e6b3c70a5af" />


---

### Similarities:

The generated output successfully captures the golden retriever as the main subject.

The pool water color and sunlight reflections match closely to the original.

The tennis ball in the dog's mouth appears accurately.

The background garden elements are reasonably similar (plants, flowers, bright outdoor environment).

### Differences:

The exact water ripple patterns may differ due to random variations in generation.

The dog’s expression, fur texture, or wetness details may not be identical.

### Prompt Adjustments for Better Accuracy:

Add more detail about the exact water depth and clarity.

Describe the fur direction and wetness more precisely.

Specify the position of lounge chairs and the stone edge structure.

Mention the camera angle (low angle, close-up shot).

# **IMAGE 2 — Anime Street Scene (Japanese Town)**


## **Original Image**

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5300486a-0253-497e-9d34-121ea42ba4fe" />


---

## **Prompt 1 — Basic Prompt**

```
A Japanese street scene with people walking and a tram in the center.
```

## **Prompt 2 — Refined Prompt**

```
An anime-style Japanese street during sunset, filled with wooden traditional shops, colorful signboards,
and people walking. A tram is stationed in the center of the road, while cherry blossom trees bloom on the left.
Students in uniforms and people in kimono walk on the street.
```

## **Prompt 3 — Final Detailed Prompt**

```
A detailed anime-style illustration of a traditional Japanese street at sunset, featuring wooden shop buildings with lanterns,
colorful vertical signboards, and blooming cherry blossoms. A vintage tram approaches the center of the street on railway tracks.
People wearing kimonos and students in school uniforms walk along the sidewalks. Soft warm lighting, pastel tones, and a nostalgic,
peaceful atmosphere inspired by classic Japanese watercolor anime art.
```

---

### Similarities

The generated image matches the anime art style and warm sunset atmosphere.

Wooden shop buildings, lanterns, and signboards appear similarly.

The tram on the tracks is included as a central feature.

Characters wearing kimonos and school uniforms match the original concept.

The soft pastel color palette is replicated well.

### Differences

Specific signboard text may differ, as AI models cannot reproduce exact copyrighted signage.

Character placement and exact clothing patterns may vary.

The tram design details may differ slightly.

Cherry blossom branch structure or petal density may not be identical.

Background buildings might vary depending on model interpretation.

### Prompt Adjustments for Better Accuracy

Add the number of lanterns, precise shop placement, and signboard colors.

Specify the tram color, shape, and style more clearly.

Add the detail that the street is crowded but calm.

Include information about hanging wires and poles to match the original.

---

## **Conclusion**

This experiment shows that text-to-image models can reproduce images effectively when prompts are detailed and well-structured. The more accurately the prompt captures visual features—objects, colors, lighting, background, and style—the closer the generated output matches the original. Iterative refinement significantly improves the final result.

---

## Result

By analyzing images, creating structured prompts, and refining them with additional detail, the model was able to generate images that closely resemble the originals. The final outputs demonstrated that:

Detailed prompts significantly improve accuracy

Artistic style can be controlled effectively

Complex scenes (like anime cityscapes) require more descriptive refinement

Realistic photos (like the dog) need strong focus on lighting and texture

Thus, prompt quality directly affects image reproduction accuracy.
